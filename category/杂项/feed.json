But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn’t actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture, highlights tea’s importance to ancient China.<br>\nArchaeological evidence suggests tea was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that’s grown around the world today, yet it was originally consumed very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green.<br>\nAfter hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged.<br>\nTea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art you might see in coffee shops today.<br>\nIn the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world’s tea trees, making tea one of three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world.<br>\nThat spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew, interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee and the plant was still only grown in China.<br>\nThe tea trade was so lucrative that the world’s fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipments of opium as a statement against Britain’s influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China’s global standing for over a century.<br>\nThe British East India company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation. He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China’s mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, the plant spread further still, helping drive tea’s rapid growth as an everyday commodity.<br>\nHowever, the Tea Act of 1778 in Britain enabled the British East India Company to trade in tea directly from China to America, thus bypassing other European exporters and American importers. This gave the British East India Company a virtual monopoly in tea trading to America and became the cause of the Boston Tea Party. The incident in which citizens of Boston boarded the British East India Company ships, dumped their tea cargoes into the sea, and sparked the American War of Independence. This event also illustrates the central role tea has played in the world.<br>\nToday, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.</p>\n",

The primary sense of the term in Europe in the Middle Ages is “knights,” or “fully armed and mounted fighting men.” Thence the term came to mean the gallantry and honor expected of knights. Later the word came to be used in its general sense of “courtesy.”<br>\nIn the High Middle Ages, chivalric knights who were able to restrain their violent impulses and channel their violence into a good cause did so because certain 12th-century authors elaborated a code of conduct or ethics that medieval nobles were expected to follow. Attempting to curb the violence and warfare that was plaguing Europe, authors created the chivalric ideal often associated with the High Middle Ages, blending older, heroic ideals with new, ecclesiastical interests. By combining elements that appealed to nobles with elements that protected the people from nobles, medieval thinkers created the chivalric ideal. In the 14th and 15th centuries the ideals of chivalry came to be associated increasingly with aristocratic display and public ceremony rather than service in the field.<br>\nThere’s a great deal of variety within the different chivalric romances. Certain authors, including Chrétien de Troyes and Marie de France, were able to craft many different kinds of chivalric heroes, each of which had his own peculiar characteristics. The variety among different authors could be even greater. This makes the attempt to define one chivalry perilous. There were almost as many different chivalries as there were chivalric romances.<br>\nEven so, common elements recur again and again in chivalric romances, both in terms of the qualities the knight should possess, and what the knight was supposed to do with these good qualities.<br>\nQualities chivalric knights were supposed to possess are stock qualities one finds in heroic literature of every period. Knights were expected to be brave, honest, loyal, and generous, and to display prowess. Fighting well was not sufficient; chivalric heroes fought spectacularly well. They didn’t simply lop off one limb with a single blow from a sword. Such heroes would cut a torso in half or cleave a person down the middle.<br>\nThe chivalric ideal, the behavior of knights, and how they were to employ these qualities, was somewhat more distinctive. Chivalric knights were expected to be courteous, to speak well, and exhibit good manners, doing things that heroes of the Early Middle Ages, such as Beowulf, did not. The former was expected to use these qualities to protect those who could not protect themselves. Knights were supposed to use their prowess, loyalty, and generosity to defend clerics, peasants, widows, virgins, orphans, or people who were any combination of the above. The more defenseless, the better. Presented with the opportunity to leap to someone’s defense, the chivalric knight seized the opportunity gladly.<br>\nThere was one group of people to whom chivalric knights were supposed to devote more attention than any other: young, sometimes single women. Chivalric knights were supposed to engage in a form of behavior that historians call “courtly love.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"love-and-romance\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#love-and-romance\">#</a> Love and Romance</h3>\n<p>The chivalric hero was supposed to fall in love and find a lady to whom he would devote all of his attention, to whom he would obey in all things. He would devote his life to winning her esteem. Once he had won her affection and respect, he would find himself ennobled to her in the moral, rather than the legal sense. The knight would find himself becoming a better person from having fallen in love with his lady, and be even more inspired to defend the defenseless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-young-knight-and-his-lady\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#a-young-knight-and-his-lady\">#</a> A young knight and his lady</h3>\n<p>Chivalric knights were supposed to fall in love. The love that a chivalric knight was supposed to feel, could come in different guises in different romances. Sometimes it was a very chaste and platonic love, a love from a distance. In some instances, the love was neither chaste nor platonic but fully consummate, and in other stories, it was love within a marriage; certain chivalric heroes marry and were expected to marry, their ladies. Sometimes the love they had was unabashedly adulterous. The lady with whom you loved didn’t have to be your wife, but the wife of your lord, for example. Chivalric authors differed among themselves as to which type of love was the best form of courtly love.</p>\n",

"<p>因群里有成员对这方面存在疑问，所以写一篇文章详细解释下游戏内性能相关。<br>\n需要注意的是，本人对于唤境中这些内容的最具体理解未必到位，因此可能出现一些技术细节上的错误，希望大佬能指出错误，感激不尽！<br>\n为了保证一般开发者也能看得懂，文章会尽量避免非常专业和硬核的描述，相应地就会降低严谨性。如果有兴趣深究，请查找更专业的资料。<br>\n此外，本文并非是针对唤境游戏的性能优化而写的，如果您的引擎或者制作的游戏出现卡顿，请前往 b 站查看小嗦大佬的教程。<br>\n传送门：<a href=\"https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wg411E7oF\">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wg411E7oF</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"一-性能相关概念基础内容\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#一-性能相关概念基础内容\">#</a> 一、性能相关概念（基础内容）</h2>\n<p>通常情况下，我们会通过几个方面来评估一个游戏运行的性能表现，分别是帧率、帧生成时间、CPU 占用、GPU 占用、内存占用、显存占用等。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-帧率-fps\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#1-帧率-fps\">#</a> 1. 帧率 / FPS</h3>\n<p>游戏之所以能呈现动态的画面，是因为它会以一个很快的速度生成画面，每秒几十张甚至上百张，其中每个画面就被称为一 “帧” 。因此，帧是游戏画面在时间上的最小单位。<br>\n于是，我们有了帧率的概念。帧率，就是每秒钟游戏生成的帧数量。很明显的，帧率越高，我们肉眼感觉到的画面就越流畅，反之则越卡顿。当帧率为 0 时，游戏就停止在一张静态的图片上。<br>\n一般而言，当帧率达到 60 时，人眼观察到的画面就可以称为 “比较流畅” 了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2帧生成时间或帧间隔-frametime\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#2帧生成时间或帧间隔-frametime\">#</a> 2. 帧生成时间（或帧间隔）/ FRAMETIME</h3>\n<p>有了帧率的概念，我们就可以引入帧生成时间的概念了。<br>\n游戏引擎每生成一帧画面，都需要消耗一定的时间，这个时间就称为帧生成时间。<br>\n帧生成时间波动是造成瞬间卡顿的原因之一。设想一个极端情况，在运行的某一秒里，游戏花了 0.9 秒来渲染第一帧，然后在剩下 0.1 秒里渲染了剩下的 59 帧。这时候的平均帧率还是 60，但是你在玩的时候就会明显感觉到游戏发生了一次剧烈的卡顿，因为这 0.9 秒的时间内游戏处于静止状态。<br>\n帧生成时间和间隔的定义，严格来说并不是完全一致的，但本文并不是进行画面技术研究，所以暂且认为它们是同一个概念。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3cpu占用-cpu\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#3cpu占用-cpu\">#</a> 3.CPU 占用 / CPU</h3>\n<p>在计算机中，CPU 负责通用计算，也就是任何计算理论上都可以由 CPU 完成。在游戏中，控制游戏系统运行、通过公式计算数据、运行函数等都是由 CPU 完成的。最开始的时候，游戏画面的渲染也是由 CPU 完成的，但后来人们发现 CPU 难以胜任这一要求，于是将这个工作交由 GPU 完成。有关这一段历史的发展，详见 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Hb41177JB<br>\n 对于现代电脑和手机来说，它们的 CPU 性能都相当强大，可以完成非常密集的运算需求。但它们的性能也不是无限的，而且在手机、笔记本电脑上，CPU 是耗电量非常大的元件。所以，CPU 会直接影响游戏的性能表现，降低 CPU 的占用率也可以有效提高游戏运行的效率，以及在低端设备上成功运行的可能性。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4gpu占用-gpu\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#4gpu占用-gpu\">#</a> 4.GPU 占用 / GPU</h3>\n<p>前面提到了，GPU 是用来替代 CPU 来完成画面渲染工作的硬件。所以，GPU 是离游戏实际画面最近的硬件，因为游戏画面就是由它生成的。<br>\nGPU 负责的内容就是渲染画面，例如显示图片、文字等。<br>\n对于唤境来说，由于唤境只是 2D 游戏引擎，因此对于现代 GPU 来说压力比较低，但还是存在运行效率过低的情况。<br>\n有关 GPU 运行解析的内容请见官方教程<a href=\"https://evkworld.cn/wiki/58\"> https://evkworld.cn/wiki/58</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"5显存占用-vram-video-memory-image-memory等\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#5显存占用-vram-video-memory-image-memory等\">#</a> 5. 显存占用 / (VRAM、VIDEO MEMORY、IMAGE MEMORY 等)</h3>\n<p>显存，又称显示内存、显卡内存、图形内存、视频内存等，是显卡用来储存图像信息的临时空间。<br>\n对于集成显卡（例如手机）而言，显存就是从内存中分出来的部分；对于独立显卡（例如高性能电脑）而言，显存是单独集成在显卡中的一个存储器。所以，当游戏在手机上运行的时候，游戏会同时消耗两份内存空间，一部分用于程序运行，另一部分充当显存。因此，如果您的游戏在电脑上运行很正常，而在低端手机上就无法运行或者特别卡顿，则有可能是因为游戏消耗了较多的显存和内存。</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"二-唤境中跟性能有关的表达式\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#二-唤境中跟性能有关的表达式\">#</a> 二、唤境中跟性能有关的表达式</h2>\n<p>唤境引擎并没有提供性能监控相关的组件和能力，但可以通过表达式获取到性能数据。<br>\n所有相关表达式都在系统部分中。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1帧率\"><a

三、制作性能监控窗口</h2>\n<p>光了解了上面所有的信息，但如果不会用，那就都是白搭。接下来，我会一步步解释如何制作游戏内的性能监控悬浮窗。</p>\n<p>1. 打开游戏项目，新建对象：一个文本、一个精灵和一个按钮，精灵的贴图替换成一张长方形图片即可<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/799e625f09a212d9e980f8cff86b3a2e.png\" alt=\"799e625f09a212d9e980f8cff86b3a2e.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../_resources/c6d47b1f64216db3965c811b0afdb06e.png\" alt=\"c6d47b1f64216db3965c811b0afdb06e.png\"></p>\n<p>2. 新建几个全局变量，“启用测量”、“悬浮窗 x”、“悬浮窗 y”。其中，第一个是布尔类型变量，是必需的；后两个是数值类型变量，不是必需的。<br>\n后两个的初始值不建议设为 0，应该根据你选择的默认位置来设置。<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/a974999ff46bbac77137dbfc7e819c24.png\" alt=\"a974999ff46bbac77137dbfc7e819c24.png\"></p>\n<p>3. 新建一个图层组 “悬浮窗”，设置为全局图层组，然后将精灵、文本和按钮拖入该图层组中，调整文本和精灵的大小及属性，文本选择左对齐、上下居中对齐，大小跟精灵差不多一样大就行<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/7cf2b2e120c5da549d4cc1c5b5008a36.png\" alt=\"7cf2b2e120c5da549d4cc1c5b5008a36.png\"><br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/2b26784c58f0c77a067d4447edbd42b4.png\" alt=\"2b26784c58f0c77a067d4447edbd42b4.png\"></p>\n<p>4. 为文本添加拖拽和定时器能力，为精灵添加绑定能力<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/f2cc5d66755ee2eb24d199e7c453ae46.png\" alt=\"f2cc5d66755ee2eb24d199e7c453ae46.png\"><br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/1751f48b11198c44c52e8e9cf67c033d.png\" alt=\"1751f48b11198c44c52e8e9cf67c033d.png\"></p>\n<p>5. 新建一条全局事件表，名称为 “性能监控窗口”，或者任何你喜欢的名字。<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/3f181abb7a3ad49aaf2f1b81b178906a.png\" alt=\"3f181abb7a3ad49aaf2f1b81b178906a.png\"></p>\n<p>6. 开始写事件。可以参考我下面的这种设计方案。<br>\n核心思路：<br>\n（1）当 “启用测量” 变量为 “真” 时，显示文本和精灵，否则隐藏；注意，不要重复触发，可以加入一个触发器（例如 “仅触发一次”）来解决；<br>\n（2）制作好看的文本排版；<br>\n（3）避免每帧检测和每帧改变文本；<br>\n（4）（可选）实现悬浮窗的拖动，以及位置记忆。<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/7b2602a886c2529d6189504f42ae5ff3.png\" alt=\"7b2602a886c2529d6189504f42ae5ff3.png\"><br>\n 文本内容供参考：<br>\n“帧率：” &amp; fps &amp; newline &amp; “CPU：” &amp; roundto (cpuutilisation*100,1) &amp; “%” &amp; newline &amp; “显存：” &amp; imagememoryusage &amp; “mb”</p>\n<p>7. 在每个你希望有监控悬浮窗的场景下都新建一个叫做 “悬浮窗” 的图层组，不需要放入任何内容，因为你之前已经选中了全局事件表。<br>\n然后将刚才写的全局事件表应用于每个你希望有悬浮窗的场景。<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/9de754a5f74cef3b19451317d1597aa9.png\" alt=\"9de754a5f74cef3b19451317d1597aa9.png\"><br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/c383bbc3f3d2d8ddb921774cdc2be8c1.png\" alt=\"c383bbc3f3d2d8ddb921774cdc2be8c1.png\"></p>\n<p>8. 检查效果<br>\n<img src=\"../_resources/50611b15f85e9e7e7164bff667699f0d.png\" alt=\"50611b15f85e9e7e7164bff667699f0d.png\"></p>\n<p>9. 可额外优化的内容</p>\n<p>拖拽能力没有进行区域限制，可以直接把悬浮窗拖到屏幕外，如何解决？<br>\n・提示：只需要使用一个能力即可解决。</p>\n<p>事件表里还有可以进一步优化的内容？<br>\n・提示：绑定能力。</p>\n<h2 id=\"四-总结\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#四-总结\">#</a> 四、总结</h2>\n<p>通过这一篇文章的解析和教学，你应该对唤境游戏的性能及其监控方法有了一定的了解。<br>\n在多数情况下，唤境游戏其实并不需要这么多高级的技术细节，但这类功能可以给你的游戏添砖加瓦，起到锦上添花的作用。<br>\n文章撰写仓促，部分内容做不到非常细致和详尽，也可能有错误，欢迎大佬前来指正！</p>\n<p>额外优化内容：<br>\n（1）给文本和精灵分别添加 “边界限制” 能力即可；<br>\n（2）在启用测量为假的时候，给精灵添加一条动作：“取消绑定”</p>\n",
