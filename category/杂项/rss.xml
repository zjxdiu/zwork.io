            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-history-of-chivalry&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-history-of-chivalry&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; The History of Chivalry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chivalry, the knightly class of feudal times. The primary sense of the term in Europe in the Middle Ages is “knights,” or “fully armed and mounted fighting men.” Thence the term came to mean the gallantry and honor expected of knights. Later the word came to be used in its general sense of “courtesy.”&lt;br&gt;
In the High Middle Ages, chivalric knights who were able to restrain their violent impulses and channel their violence into a good cause did so because certain 12th-century authors elaborated a code of conduct or ethics that medieval nobles were expected to follow. Attempting to curb the violence and warfare that was plaguing Europe, authors created the chivalric ideal often associated with the High Middle Ages, blending older, heroic ideals with new, ecclesiastical interests. By combining elements that appealed to nobles with elements that protected the people from nobles, medieval thinkers created the chivalric ideal. In the 14th and 15th centuries the ideals of chivalry came to be associated increasingly with aristocratic display and public ceremony rather than service in the field.&lt;br&gt;
There’s a great deal of variety within the different chivalric romances. Certain authors, including Chrétien de Troyes and Marie de France, were able to craft many different kinds of chivalric heroes, each of which had his own peculiar characteristics. The variety among different authors could be even greater. This makes the attempt to define one chivalry perilous. There were almost as many different chivalries as there were chivalric romances.&lt;br&gt;
Even so, common elements recur again and again in chivalric romances, both in terms of the qualities the knight should possess, and what the knight was supposed to do with these good qualities.&lt;br&gt;
Qualities chivalric knights were supposed to possess are stock qualities one finds in heroic literature of every period. Knights were expected to be brave, honest, loyal, and generous, and to display prowess. Fighting well was not sufficient; chivalric heroes fought spectacularly well. They didn’t simply lop off one limb with a single blow from a sword. Such heroes would cut a torso in half or cleave a person down the middle.&lt;br&gt;
The chivalric ideal, the behavior of knights, and how they were to employ these qualities, was somewhat more distinctive. Chivalric knights were expected to be courteous, to speak well, and exhibit good manners, doing things that heroes of the Early Middle Ages, such as Beowulf, did not. The former was expected to use these qualities to protect those who could not protect themselves. Knights were supposed to use their prowess, loyalty, and generosity to defend clerics, peasants, widows, virgins, orphans, or people who were any combination of the above. The more defenseless, the better. Presented with the opportunity to leap to someone’s defense, the chivalric knight seized the opportunity gladly.&lt;br&gt;
There was one group of people to whom chivalric knights were supposed to devote more attention than any other: young, sometimes single women. Chivalric knights were supposed to engage in a form of behavior that historians call “courtly love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;love-and-romance&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#love-and-romance&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Love and Romance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chivalric hero was supposed to fall in love and find a lady to whom he would devote all of his attention, to whom he would obey in all things. He would devote his life to winning her esteem. Once he had won her affection and respect, he would find himself ennobled to her in the moral, rather than the legal sense. The knight would find himself becoming a better person from having fallen in love with his lady, and be even more inspired to defend the defenseless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-young-knight-and-his-lady&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#a-young-knight-and-his-lady&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; A young knight and his lady&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chivalric knights were supposed to fall in love. The love that a chivalric knight was supposed to feel, could come in different guises in different romances. Sometimes it was a very chaste and platonic love, a love from a distance. In some instances, the love was neither chaste nor platonic but fully consummate, and in other stories, it was love within a marriage; certain chivalric heroes marry and were expected to marry, their ladies. Sometimes the love they had was unabashedly adulterous. The lady with whom you loved didn’t have to be your wife, but the wife of your lord, for example. Chivalric authors differed among themselves as to which type of love was the best form of courtly love.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;h2 id=&#34;the-history-of-tea&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-history-of-tea&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; The History of Tea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a long day spent roaming the forest in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn’t actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture, highlights tea’s importance to ancient China.&lt;br&gt;
Archaeological evidence suggests tea was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that’s grown around the world today, yet it was originally consumed very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green.&lt;br&gt;
After hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged.&lt;br&gt;
Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art you might see in coffee shops today.&lt;br&gt;
In the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world’s tea trees, making tea one of three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world.&lt;br&gt;
That spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew, interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee and the plant was still only grown in China.&lt;br&gt;
The tea trade was so lucrative that the world’s fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipments of opium as a statement against Britain’s influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China’s global standing for over a century.&lt;br&gt;
The British East India company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China in a covert operation. He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China’s mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, the plant spread further still, helping drive tea’s rapid growth as an everyday commodity.&lt;br&gt;
However, the Tea Act of 1778 in Britain enabled the British East India Company to trade in tea directly from China to America, thus bypassing other European exporters and American importers. This gave the British East India Company a virtual monopoly in tea trading to America and became the cause of the Boston Tea Party. The incident in which citizens of Boston boarded the British East India Company ships, dumped their tea cargoes into the sea, and sparked the American War of Independence. This event also illustrates the central role tea has played in the world.&lt;br&gt;
Today, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zerotier 内网穿透&lt;br&gt;
网上有一些教程，但是不够简洁易懂，所以写一个。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;进入&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.zerotier.com/&#34;&gt;官网控制台&lt;/a&gt;注册一个账号，可以不用现场注册，直接微软账号登录即可。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;选择 Create A Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;点击刚创建的网络，进入配置界面
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name 随便写一个方便你记的名字&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description 是介绍，可以写详细信息，如果以后忘了网络是干啥的可以看这个回顾&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Control 建议选 Private，这样你就拥有完全的管理权限&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;下面的 IP 直接自动即可，或者手动选一个跟你目前局域网 IP 不冲突的地址段&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPv6 Auto-Assign 根据情况选择，如果你们的网络成员都具有广域网 ipv6 连接则勾选第一项，否则不管&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;最后复制 Network ID，就是一串数字和字母组成的字符串，发给你的成员&lt;br&gt;
【以上步骤只需要网络管理员进行，成员不需要】&lt;br&gt;
【以下内容每个人都要执行】&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;下载 Zerotier：&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zerotier.com/download/&#34;&gt;下载链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;安装并从开始菜单里启动&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;等任务栏出现程序图标，右键，选择 Join New Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;输入刚才的 Network ID，确定
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果弹出询问弹窗，例如防火墙、是否启用网络发现等，均允许&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;等待几分钟，进入系统设置检查 IP 是否获取成功
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;分配成功说明连接成功，否则继续等待&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;【重要】任意成员加入网络时，需要进入&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.zerotier.com/&#34;&gt;官网控制台&lt;/a&gt;给成员左侧的 Auth 打勾，只有打勾的成员才能获取到 IP 并加入网络，否则无法连接&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在控制台页面可以看到每个人的虚拟局域网 IP，这个地址一旦分配就不会自动更改，因此你甚至可以做个 DNS 记录方便大家记（）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ping 一下成员的 IP，确定连接通顺&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;完成！现在你们已经相当于在一个局域网里了，只不过游戏房间和服务器可能不会自动查找到，手动输入地址即可。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;查询精神状态&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#查询精神状态&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 查询精神状态&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近玩 LLM 有点上瘾，推荐一个 chatGLM 项目&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B&#34;&gt; Github 地址&lt;/a&gt;，可以部署在本地运行的对话机器人，这个 62 亿参数的模型只需要 6G 显存就能运行（当然，是 N 卡），可以说非常好玩了（）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还想换个主题，或者再开一个功能更全面一些的，这个极简博客就当正式文章和简历发布地点。&lt;br&gt;
就这样吧，最近作业很多但是都写完了，没有压力就没有折腾的欲望和动力 (T_T)&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 23:51:00 +0800</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;h2 id=&#34;事件初始&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#事件初始&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 事件初始&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在 2021 年，我入坑了灵魂潮汐；作为副游，她已经做到了尽善尽美。具体不再阐述，有兴趣可自行前往&lt;a href=&#34;https://lhcx.iqigame.net/&#34;&gt;官网&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后，在大约 2022 年中的时候，有几次游戏大更新；有一天我意外地发现，游戏登录前的加载界面不再是寂静无声，而是加入了一段非常好听的音乐！&lt;br&gt;
当时这段音乐就让我沉醉了，游戏都没肝就直接跑去 b 站找官方账号。很幸运，我找到了视频；不幸的是，官方视频里的歌曲不是同一个人唱的 😦&lt;br&gt;
但是它实在太好听了，所以之后我又琢磨着怎么把这段音乐录下来。于是就有了后续的折腾环节。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;尝试录制&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#尝试录制&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 尝试录制&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不详细说了，我试了以下的方法：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;手机内置录屏&lt;br&gt;
失败的原因很简单，手机内置的录屏音质不佳，更是只有单声道；显然我是不可能选择这个方式的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;电脑模拟器&lt;br&gt;
同样失败；当时我用的是一众包装好的安卓模拟器，包括夜神、Mumu、联想手机助手等。失败的原因是，这些模拟器的音质同样不高，而且似乎只在游戏界面上才会发生，具体表现就是声音没有高频，12kHz 以上的频率全部被切除，听起来就像 96kbps 的电话音质一样。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;其它手机软件&lt;br&gt;
找了很久，找到一个能够读取原始 RAW 音频数据进而录屏的手机软件；但是这种方法有个很大的缺陷，就是它会同时把麦克风的声音混进去，而且无法分离；手机麦克风的噪音很大，非常影响听感，更何况环境噪声无处不在，不能实现完美的录制条件。禁用麦克风权限则所有声音都不能被录制，因此该方法 pass。&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;初次解决方案&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#初次解决方案&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 初次解决方案&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最终，我用一个很奇怪的方法达成了目标：&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;多屏协同。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
对，就是华为手机支持的那个。当时我用的是荣耀 magic2 和 magicbook pro，多屏协同是很容易实现的。&lt;br&gt;
通过多屏协同，手机的声音直接在电脑上播放，而且延迟低音质高（相对）。&lt;br&gt;
随后在电脑上用 Au 录制，配上官方的视频画面，我就直接投稿到 b 站。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是没几天我就发现了被我忽略的问题，那就是多屏协同的音质同样不是最佳；它会切除 16kHz 以上的音频，导致听感近似 128kbps 的低质量音频（尽管在这首歌里似乎不明显，几乎没感觉音质有多差）。当然，那时我也没想到更好的办法，于是这个视频就一直放着，还逐渐收获了 1.1W 的播放量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;二次折腾&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#二次折腾&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 二次折腾&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就在今天晚上，我在整理 b 站的各类信息和配置，无意间点进了创作中心，看到了视频的最新评论。有人问我是怎么获得高音质音频的，于是我就把这个过程说了一遍。&lt;br&gt;
但是这个时候，我决定要彻底解决问题，获取原始的最高音质音频；一直用着低质量音乐冒充高品质原声始终不太好，于是我又着手开始折腾。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;重新尝试虚拟机&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;微软的 WSA：失败，win10 没有成功启动&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VirtualBox 虚拟机：失败，音频要么呈现断断续续的极为难听的状态，要么就只有之前遇到过的低质量。&lt;br&gt;
此时我也已经明白，实际上模拟器音质不高基本上就是由于音频设备的原因，使用 Windows Audio Session+ICH AC97 能得到唯一流畅的声音输出，但质量低。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;聪明反被聪明误&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#聪明反被聪明误&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 聪明反被聪明误&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没错，自作聪明的结果就是我这样，折腾了两回一点用都没有。&lt;br&gt;
就在我放弃折腾准备关机睡觉的时候，我就忽然想到，为什么我不直接把手机的耳机孔输出连接到电脑的音频口呢？这样电脑直接就能接收到手机的音频输出，直接录制最原始的声音。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个方法听起来很蠢，但它就是最快捷最有效的方法。换了几条线，我发现只要把 Realtek 的声音设备设置为麦克风，关闭所有麦克风增强、效果和加强，配合一根 AUX（3.5mm 公对公）转接线就能直接在电脑上录音了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;b站的阴间操作&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#b站的阴间操作&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; b 站的阴间操作&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;终于得到了完美的录音，当然是要换源了，让后面的观众能享受到最佳的音质！&lt;br&gt;
一顿操作，把之前的视频替换音轨，重新上传。&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;10分钟后...&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 嗯，新上传的视频，音频直接被压缩到了 74kbps，听起来比电话还糊。&lt;br&gt;
b 站，😃&lt;br&gt;
时间已经比较晚了，我也不想继续折腾，直接投了个音频投稿然后关联过来，同时发新的文件下载链接置顶，就这样吧。反正问题算是解决了，就是这个结尾整的我有点脑溢血（&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;在群里看到一张图：&lt;br&gt;
（很长，谨慎观看）&lt;br&gt;
觉得很有意思，所以来尝试一手&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/dd3a38e57001d9152146cbdaf57f5e79.png&#34; alt=&#34;dd3a38e57001d9152146cbdaf57f5e79.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;zjxdiu 写作风格：&lt;br&gt;
平淡的一天，我照常乘坐拥挤的地铁下班回家。一成不变的枯燥工作使我身心俱疲，但更糟心的事情，正在发生。&lt;br&gt;
那看上去似乎已是中老年的身影逐渐靠近，并不瘦弱的身躯似乎隐藏着对全世界的恶意。他走到我的身边，停下了脚步。&lt;br&gt;
“没看到这里写着爱心座位吗？” 一边说着，他举起手上的雨伞就是一次猛戳。&lt;br&gt;
我避之不及，匆忙间只躲过了伞柄尖端，雨水依旧顺着伞面滑落到我的衣服上。渗透的雨水寒冷刺骨，却远不及我心中的冷意。&lt;br&gt;
起身让开了座位，主动忽略了身旁的异样眼光，我只是默然想道：&lt;br&gt;
“终有一日，施加于他人的善与恶，会再次回到自己身边。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;草（指草本植物），真的没写过第一人称，也没写过现实内容，buff 拉满了，感觉跟自己的真实风格差距有亿点大。&lt;br&gt;
还有想尝试的还能继续留言（&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;因群里有成员对这方面存在疑问，所以写一篇文章详细解释下游戏内性能相关。&lt;br&gt;
需要注意的是，本人对于唤境中这些内容的最具体理解未必到位，因此可能出现一些技术细节上的错误，希望大佬能指出错误，感激不尽！&lt;br&gt;
为了保证一般开发者也能看得懂，文章会尽量避免非常专业和硬核的描述，相应地就会降低严谨性。如果有兴趣深究，请查找更专业的资料。&lt;br&gt;
此外，本文并非是针对唤境游戏的性能优化而写的，如果您的引擎或者制作的游戏出现卡顿，请前往 b 站查看小嗦大佬的教程。&lt;br&gt;
传送门：&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wg411E7oF&#34;&gt;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wg411E7oF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;一-性能相关概念基础内容&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#一-性能相关概念基础内容&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 一、性能相关概念（基础内容）&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通常情况下，我们会通过几个方面来评估一个游戏运行的性能表现，分别是帧率、帧生成时间、CPU 占用、GPU 占用、内存占用、显存占用等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-帧率-fps&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#1-帧率-fps&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 1. 帧率 / FPS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;游戏之所以能呈现动态的画面，是因为它会以一个很快的速度生成画面，每秒几十张甚至上百张，其中每个画面就被称为一 “帧” 。因此，帧是游戏画面在时间上的最小单位。&lt;br&gt;
于是，我们有了帧率的概念。帧率，就是每秒钟游戏生成的帧数量。很明显的，帧率越高，我们肉眼感觉到的画面就越流畅，反之则越卡顿。当帧率为 0 时，游戏就停止在一张静态的图片上。&lt;br&gt;
一般而言，当帧率达到 60 时，人眼观察到的画面就可以称为 “比较流畅” 了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2帧生成时间或帧间隔-frametime&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#2帧生成时间或帧间隔-frametime&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 2. 帧生成时间（或帧间隔）/ FRAMETIME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有了帧率的概念，我们就可以引入帧生成时间的概念了。&lt;br&gt;
游戏引擎每生成一帧画面，都需要消耗一定的时间，这个时间就称为帧生成时间。&lt;br&gt;
帧生成时间波动是造成瞬间卡顿的原因之一。设想一个极端情况，在运行的某一秒里，游戏花了 0.9 秒来渲染第一帧，然后在剩下 0.1 秒里渲染了剩下的 59 帧。这时候的平均帧率还是 60，但是你在玩的时候就会明显感觉到游戏发生了一次剧烈的卡顿，因为这 0.9 秒的时间内游戏处于静止状态。&lt;br&gt;
帧生成时间和间隔的定义，严格来说并不是完全一致的，但本文并不是进行画面技术研究，所以暂且认为它们是同一个概念。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3cpu占用-cpu&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#3cpu占用-cpu&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 3.CPU 占用 / CPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在计算机中，CPU 负责通用计算，也就是任何计算理论上都可以由 CPU 完成。在游戏中，控制游戏系统运行、通过公式计算数据、运行函数等都是由 CPU 完成的。最开始的时候，游戏画面的渲染也是由 CPU 完成的，但后来人们发现 CPU 难以胜任这一要求，于是将这个工作交由 GPU 完成。有关这一段历史的发展，详见 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Hb41177JB&lt;br&gt;
 对于现代电脑和手机来说，它们的 CPU 性能都相当强大，可以完成非常密集的运算需求。但它们的性能也不是无限的，而且在手机、笔记本电脑上，CPU 是耗电量非常大的元件。所以，CPU 会直接影响游戏的性能表现，降低 CPU 的占用率也可以有效提高游戏运行的效率，以及在低端设备上成功运行的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4gpu占用-gpu&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#4gpu占用-gpu&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 4.GPU 占用 / GPU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前面提到了，GPU 是用来替代 CPU 来完成画面渲染工作的硬件。所以，GPU 是离游戏实际画面最近的硬件，因为游戏画面就是由它生成的。&lt;br&gt;
GPU 负责的内容就是渲染画面，例如显示图片、文字等。&lt;br&gt;
对于唤境来说，由于唤境只是 2D 游戏引擎，因此对于现代 GPU 来说压力比较低，但还是存在运行效率过低的情况。&lt;br&gt;
有关 GPU 运行解析的内容请见官方教程&lt;a href=&#34;https://evkworld.cn/wiki/58&#34;&gt; https://evkworld.cn/wiki/58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5显存占用-vram-video-memory-image-memory等&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#5显存占用-vram-video-memory-image-memory等&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 5. 显存占用 / (VRAM、VIDEO MEMORY、IMAGE MEMORY 等)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;显存，又称显示内存、显卡内存、图形内存、视频内存等，是显卡用来储存图像信息的临时空间。&lt;br&gt;
对于集成显卡（例如手机）而言，显存就是从内存中分出来的部分；对于独立显卡（例如高性能电脑）而言，显存是单独集成在显卡中的一个存储器。所以，当游戏在手机上运行的时候，游戏会同时消耗两份内存空间，一部分用于程序运行，另一部分充当显存。因此，如果您的游戏在电脑上运行很正常，而在低端手机上就无法运行或者特别卡顿，则有可能是因为游戏消耗了较多的显存和内存。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;二-唤境中跟性能有关的表达式&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#二-唤境中跟性能有关的表达式&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 二、唤境中跟性能有关的表达式&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;唤境引擎并没有提供性能监控相关的组件和能力，但可以通过表达式获取到性能数据。&lt;br&gt;
所有相关表达式都在系统部分中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1帧率&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#1帧率&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 1. 帧率&lt;/h3&gt;

 刷新频率：每帧 1 次&lt;br&gt;
返回值类型：9 位小数。&lt;br&gt;
建议使用方法：直接通过表达式获取即可。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/4b1452908420640a6ac75af4bb2b156e.png&#34; alt=&#34;4b1452908420640a6ac75af4bb2b156e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;三-制作性能监控窗口&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#三-制作性能监控窗口&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 三、制作性能监控窗口&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;光了解了上面所有的信息，但如果不会用，那就都是白搭。接下来，我会一步步解释如何制作游戏内的性能监控悬浮窗。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. 打开游戏项目，新建对象：一个文本、一个精灵和一个按钮，精灵的贴图替换成一张长方形图片即可&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/799e625f09a212d9e980f8cff86b3a2e.png&#34; alt=&#34;799e625f09a212d9e980f8cff86b3a2e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/c6d47b1f64216db3965c811b0afdb06e.png&#34; alt=&#34;c6d47b1f64216db3965c811b0afdb06e.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. 新建几个全局变量，“启用测量”、“悬浮窗 x”、“悬浮窗 y”。其中，第一个是布尔类型变量，是必需的；后两个是数值类型变量，不是必需的。&lt;br&gt;
后两个的初始值不建议设为 0，应该根据你选择的默认位置来设置。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/a974999ff46bbac77137dbfc7e819c24.png&#34; alt=&#34;a974999ff46bbac77137dbfc7e819c24.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. 新建一个图层组 “悬浮窗”，设置为全局图层组，然后将精灵、文本和按钮拖入该图层组中，调整文本和精灵的大小及属性，文本选择左对齐、上下居中对齐，大小跟精灵差不多一样大就行&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/7cf2b2e120c5da549d4cc1c5b5008a36.png&#34; alt=&#34;7cf2b2e120c5da549d4cc1c5b5008a36.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/2b26784c58f0c77a067d4447edbd42b4.png&#34; alt=&#34;2b26784c58f0c77a067d4447edbd42b4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. 为文本添加拖拽和定时器能力，为精灵添加绑定能力&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/f2cc5d66755ee2eb24d199e7c453ae46.png&#34; alt=&#34;f2cc5d66755ee2eb24d199e7c453ae46.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/1751f48b11198c44c52e8e9cf67c033d.png&#34; alt=&#34;1751f48b11198c44c52e8e9cf67c033d.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. 新建一条全局事件表，名称为 “性能监控窗口”，或者任何你喜欢的名字。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/3f181abb7a3ad49aaf2f1b81b178906a.png&#34; alt=&#34;3f181abb7a3ad49aaf2f1b81b178906a.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. 开始写事件。可以参考我下面的这种设计方案。&lt;br&gt;
核心思路：&lt;br&gt;
（1）当 “启用测量” 变量为 “真” 时，显示文本和精灵，否则隐藏；注意，不要重复触发，可以加入一个触发器（例如 “仅触发一次”）来解决；&lt;br&gt;
（2）制作好看的文本排版；&lt;br&gt;
（3）避免每帧检测和每帧改变文本；&lt;br&gt;
（4）（可选）实现悬浮窗的拖动，以及位置记忆。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/7b2602a886c2529d6189504f42ae5ff3.png&#34; alt=&#34;7b2602a886c2529d6189504f42ae5ff3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 文本内容供参考：&lt;br&gt;
“帧率：” &amp;amp; fps &amp;amp; newline &amp;amp; “CPU：” &amp;amp; roundto (cpuutilisation*100,1) &amp;amp; “%” &amp;amp; newline &amp;amp; “显存：” &amp;amp; imagememoryusage &amp;amp; “mb”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. 在每个你希望有监控悬浮窗的场景下都新建一个叫做 “悬浮窗” 的图层组，不需要放入任何内容，因为你之前已经选中了全局事件表。&lt;br&gt;
然后将刚才写的全局事件表应用于每个你希望有悬浮窗的场景。&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/9de754a5f74cef3b19451317d1597aa9.png&#34; alt=&#34;9de754a5f74cef3b19451317d1597aa9.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/c383bbc3f3d2d8ddb921774cdc2be8c1.png&#34; alt=&#34;c383bbc3f3d2d8ddb921774cdc2be8c1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. 检查效果&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/50611b15f85e9e7e7164bff667699f0d.png&#34; alt=&#34;50611b15f85e9e7e7164bff667699f0d.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. 可额外优化的内容&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拖拽能力没有进行区域限制，可以直接把悬浮窗拖到屏幕外，如何解决？&lt;br&gt;
・提示：只需要使用一个能力即可解决。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事件表里还有可以进一步优化的内容？&lt;br&gt;
・提示：绑定能力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;四-总结&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#四-总结&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 四、总结&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过这一篇文章的解析和教学，你应该对唤境游戏的性能及其监控方法有了一定的了解。&lt;br&gt;
在多数情况下，唤境游戏其实并不需要这么多高级的技术细节，但这类功能可以给你的游戏添砖加瓦，起到锦上添花的作用。&lt;br&gt;
文章撰写仓促，部分内容做不到非常细致和详尽，也可能有错误，欢迎大佬前来指正！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;额外优化内容：&lt;br&gt;
（1）给文本和精灵分别添加 “边界限制” 能力即可；&lt;br&gt;
（2）在启用测量为假的时候，给精灵添加一条动作：“取消绑定”&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.163.com/song?id=28279678&amp;amp;userid=438146708&#34;&gt;点击收听：S.O.S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/5606f288e66c105e4ddd37b5b8a9631b.png&#34; alt=&#34;5606f288e66c105e4ddd37b5b8a9631b.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;意志正在消沉，希望正在燃尽。&lt;br&gt;
忽然听到了这样一个声音，她将我唤醒，又让我陷入无止尽的幻想。她给予我无穷无尽的力量，却又让我更深地沉醉。&lt;br&gt;
在我有记忆以来，这是我听过的最美的歌声。她在歌曲中只出现在副歌部分，但那份空灵，蕴含在声音中的情感，却是狠狠地撞击我的心脏。我的灵魂发出呐喊，却无法挣脱，甘愿自己被她迷醉。&lt;br&gt;
她的声音，几乎完美地符合我的审美感知。我相信，也有更多人会被她的声音吸引。&lt;br&gt;
并不是很确定她的声音是否是歌曲信息中的那个歌手，但我确信自己不会忘记她带给我的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;她是海中的精灵，也是海洋之神的化身。&lt;br&gt;
她的呼吸，会化作海浪和潮汐。挥手轻舞，就能平息一场海啸。从没有人见过她，但每个被她庇护的人都会梦到她。&lt;br&gt;
传说，在大海的中央，会有一位看不见的海妖。每当船只丢失航线、误入她的领地时，她会唱起来自海洋的歌声，保护船只免遭暗礁和巨石的侵袭。&lt;br&gt;
但是，这并不是无条件的施舍。&lt;br&gt;
时常有游船丢失方向经过这里。其上的许多人类在得知自己可能无法抵达彼岸后，露出无尽的丑态。&lt;br&gt;
人们将自己的行为解释为末日前最后的狂欢。&lt;br&gt;
但她不会同意。&lt;br&gt;
心存善念的人会被她迷惑，但最终会被海浪带回自己的故乡。&lt;br&gt;
而欲望和恶念过多的人，会在自然的力量下灰飞烟灭。&lt;br&gt;
但是，当她听到人们心中的祈祷、看到人们眼中的痛苦与绝望时&lt;br&gt;
她总会感同身受。&lt;br&gt;
所以，她的歌声，大多都是如赎罪之人的挽歌一般，绝望中带着希冀，从未断开内心中的那一丝神念。&lt;br&gt;
人们的心灵会得到净化，他们会忘记自己的遭遇，但会平安回到家人面前。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;歌词如下&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;hljs stata&#34;&gt;C&amp;#x27;&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;est&lt;/span&gt; un SOS,je suis touché&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; je suis à terre
这是来自远方的求助（因迷茫而搁浅）
Entends-tu &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;ma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;étresse, y&amp;#x27;a t-il quelqu&amp;#x27;un ?
是否有人能感触到那一丝的痛苦？
Je sens &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;que&lt;/span&gt; je me perds
我已彻底迷失了方向
J&amp;#x27;ai tout quitté, mais ne &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x27;&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;en&lt;/span&gt; veux pas
不要怪我曾经的选择（舍弃一切）
Fallait &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;que&lt;/span&gt; je &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x27;&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;en&lt;/span&gt; aille, je &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x27;étais plus moi
只有选择离开，我才能（告被从前）做回自己
Je suis tombé&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; tellement bas
我也为此伤心难过到了极点
&lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;Que&lt;/span&gt; plus personne ne me voit
没人能真正理解我的苦处
J&amp;#x27;ai sombré dans &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x27;anonymat
我隐姓埋名
Combattu le vide et le froid, le froid
社会的打拼，让我倍感人情的冷漠
J&amp;#x27;aimerais revenir , j&amp;#x27; &lt;span class=&#34;hljs-keyword&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x27;y arrive pas
我真的很想回去，但却有不知该怎么办
J&amp;#x27;aimerais revenir
我真的很想回去
Je suis rien, je suis personne
我碌碌无为，卑躬屈膝

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;吐槽部分。&lt;br&gt;
图是自己用 AI 画的，故事是自己写的，音乐听的是自己放慢的。&lt;br&gt;
一边写一边听着这首歌，写到最后两句话，眼泪忽然就没绷住。&lt;br&gt;
明明自己如此痛恨人性的丑陋，却仍然存有无尽的怜悯。哪怕在自己胡编乱造的故事中，都不曾改变。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一直以来，我的共情能力其实就很强。也不知道以后做带有刀片的剧情的时候，自己会不会先把眼泪流干。&lt;br&gt;
但是，我又如此享受这种感觉。我不想做眼中只有利益，而忽略了感情的人。&lt;br&gt;
也许，这就是神性与人性的冲突吧。作为人类，我们如此矛盾，却又如此和谐。&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/bae16920a3e51780c72e170d6411a8ac.png&#34; alt=&#34;bae16920a3e51780c72e170d6411a8ac.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 人在上课，突闻噩耗。&lt;br&gt;
虽然现在的新冠并没有两年前那么恐怖，见者九死一生，但仍然是流感中较为严重的一类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近全国各地都突然严重爆发，我学校的老校区也出现了阳性感染者，这实在不是什么好消息。&lt;br&gt;
不过，疫情虽然对经济冲击严重，但我们仍然可能可以从另一个角度思考问题，试图以积极的方式面对。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在 2020 年中，大约是（延期后的）高考结束的那个暑期，我们经历了一次非常恐怖的矿潮。那时候，显卡的价格飞涨到一个离谱都不足以形容的地步，而正值开学季的准大学生们则欲哭无泪：想买电脑，根本抢不到！&lt;br&gt;
尽管当时笔记本电脑缺货更多是由于芯片供应短缺造成的，但挖矿的影响同样不可忽视。而就在大家想着如何用合理的价格买到自己心仪的显卡时，有一些人则希望大家能够从另一个角度来看待这个问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;有时候达成你的目标和需求不止一种方法；面对畸形的市场，与其抱怨，不如换一种新的思维来看待这件事&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这句话确实给了我不少启发和灵感。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;这是一个给你折腾机会的完美时机&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#这是一个给你折腾机会的完美时机&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 这是一个给你折腾机会的完美时机&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所谓折腾，就是你可以干任何以前你想干但缺乏时机的事。当然，如果你想环游世界，那可能还是之后再说吧（？）&lt;br&gt;
举个例子，我利用高中被疫情困在家里的时间，自己学习了非常多的东西，包括但不限于：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;网络工程与应用&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;服务器搭建与优化&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;网页前端设计&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;游戏开发入门&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这些都是我理解的 “折腾”，平时由于高三学习压力较大、学校里不能自由使用手机和电脑，这些东西都没有机会学习和实践。&lt;br&gt;
而利用好了这几个月，我认为我在折腾中收获颇丰，并为进入大学后的生活提供了十足的帮助。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../_resources/a5e6e966826c7b2508826b512966be12.png&#34; alt=&#34;a5e6e966826c7b2508826b512966be12.png&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 这是我在一个月内做的网页前端设计，并应用于自己家庭的内网中，以便实现我的学习电脑与打印服务器电脑（配置很低很卡）之间进行快速的文件传输和通信。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;这是一个可以锻炼你眼光的合理时机&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#这是一个可以锻炼你眼光的合理时机&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 这是一个可以锻炼你眼光的合理时机&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果要折腾，你肯定免不了要花点钱，有的甚至开销很大（比如我喜欢折腾电脑硬件，这就是花费很高的一种）。但正是因为花销大，才能锻炼我的眼光，确切来说是我选购东西的眼光。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近正在考虑折腾一个服务器电脑。家里有闲置的笔记本和台式机，也许我可以改造台式机，重新选择 ITX 机箱和静音散热器，并将其作为服务器主机使用。&lt;br&gt;
或者，也可以另外花费 240 左右购买 J1900 准系统迷你主机，这种方案的优势是被动散热无噪音、寿命长，硬盘我已经有一块可用的 SSD，还可以顺便折腾 Windows server 2007 等系统，加上我本人对能折腾的迷你电脑比较感兴趣，这似乎是不错的选择。&lt;br&gt;
然而，这个方案最大的问题就是开销更多；买一个 ITX 机箱 + 低噪散热器的价格显然低于准系统 + 内存的价格，所以这就对我的选购能力提出了严峻的挑战。虽然我并没有实际购买，但在这个过程中，我能感觉到自己网购眼光的提升。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;总结&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#总结&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 总结&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;积极面对这 ** 的世界，听起来并不是一件轻松的事，毕竟谁能在生存受阻的情况下坦然自若呢？但是，苦中作乐本就是身具人性的最大优势，而我们不应该让其淹没在无穷无尽的原始需求中。&lt;br&gt;
最后，为这个尚存一线美好的世界送上祝福，希望每个真诚的人都能被温柔以待。&lt;br&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;h2 id=&#34;关于青羽&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#关于青羽&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 关于青羽&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你好，我是 zjxdiu，在这个空间里我也叫青羽 b（￣▽￣）d&lt;br&gt;
 其实这个名字应该会和其他人的重吧，但是我一直觉得叫自己 zjxdiu 也太奇怪了（下面会说这个 id 的由来），然后当我试图想一个符合我自设的名字的时候，“青” 和 “羽” 这两个发音就出现在脑海里（就是 “Pop” 一下就冒出来了），所以我觉得叫自己青羽似乎也不错。&lt;br&gt;
自设内容会慢慢完善，单独放在 “关于” 里。谁不希望把自己塑造成最喜欢的样子呢，现在我有了自己的网络空间，我就是这里的神（？）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;关于zjxdiu&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#关于zjxdiu&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 关于 zjxdiu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是我的网络常用 id，一些平台里搜索这个 id 找到的大概都是我。&lt;br&gt;
它的来源其实有点蠢（dumb）&lt;br&gt;
这个 id 分成两部分，前面是 zjx，也就是我的名字首字母拼一起；后面是 diu，它是源于粤语里的一句脏话，然后初中的时候班上同学天天把 diu 挂在嘴边。&lt;br&gt;
这还不是全部，当我辗转于各大 mc 服务器时，我意外地发现，diu 这个 id 被占用的概率很低，于是那段时间我的 minecraft 用户名一直叫 diu。&lt;br&gt;
再长大一点，我觉得只叫 diu 也很容易听出一些低俗感，所以我把两部分拼起来，变成了 zjxdiu。&lt;br&gt;
虽然还是很难通过英语来阅读这个词，但它确实是伴随着我到大学，一路走过来的 id。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;个人资料&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#个人资料&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 个人资料&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就读于长沙理工大学，今年大三。&lt;br&gt;
什么领域都想涉及，软件、硬件、网络工程、音乐制作、音频处理、视频剪辑、游戏开发、平面设计… 但实际上并没有哪个是学得很好的。&lt;br&gt;
外表是壮汉，内心世界却很单纯。不愿猜测叵测的人心，却总是被迫卷入一次次的纷争。&lt;br&gt;
这也是我将虚拟名字定为青羽的原因，总是幻想自己如一缕白羽，随青风而去，附于一片枝叶，不为任何人事所困。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;联系方式等&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;markdownIt-Anchor&#34; href=&#34;#联系方式等&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; 联系方式等&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个博客提供很多好友服务，主要针对（之后会有的）幻想世界，包括但不限于：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对世界观作出修改和补充&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;提交自己的角色设定&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;获得免费的 AI 角色图集&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;更多内容尽请期待&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为我不会后端，也不会前端（），所以这里不提供评论服务。如果想发表吐槽、评论、意见等，可以通过邮箱告知；我会不定期进行更新，加入一些有意思的内容。&lt;br&gt;
可以通过以下方式联系我：&lt;br&gt;
常用平台 id：zjxdiu&lt;br&gt;
QQ：2987631086&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;请在添加好友时说明你是从哪里找到我号码的，否则可能不会同意申请&lt;br&gt;
 E-mail：zjxdiu@qq.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;可以用于提交各种东西，向我提问，等等&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;友情链接功能还没调试好，暂时不开放…&lt;/p&gt;
